6502 Emulator and IDE

[marian-c.github.io](https://marian-c.github.io)

## Emulator

This is a 6502 based computer loosely based on the Ben Eater component but extensible enough that you can make emulate 
different configurations. You can upload your own binaries or use the IDE feature

## IDE

This also allows you to write your assembler code, compile it and run it in one go.


## Development

See the [.nvmrc](.nvmrc) file for the recommended node version

First time setup, install node dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

Start the application in development mode:

```shell
npm run dev
```
