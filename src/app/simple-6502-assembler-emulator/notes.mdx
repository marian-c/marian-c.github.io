# Simple 6502 assembler and emulator

The widget above allows you to emulate a fantasy 6502 based computer. You can provide your own ROM file, or you can use
the integrated editor (labeled Compiler) to write a custom program in 6502 assembly language.

This widget is designed to work on wide screens; using this on a mobile device is not supported.

## Main controls

The toolbar at the top of the widget contains the main controls:

- <Button className="mr-2 not-prose" title="Start/continue execution" inaccessibleChildren={<Icon src="/static_assets/svg/play.svg" />} />
  This will start/resume the emulation, it will not compile the source in the Compiler tab and it will not reset anything.
  It just starts the emulation with whatever contents are in the ROM. While the emulator is running this button will
  be disabled.
- <Button className="mr-2 not-prose" title="Pause execution" inaccessibleChildren={<Icon src="/static_assets/svg/pause.svg" />} />
  If the emulator is running, use this button to pause it;
- <Button className="mr-2 not-prose" title="Build source" inaccessibleChildren={<Icon src="/static_assets/svg/build.svg" />} />
  When the Compiler tab is visible, this button will build the source code. This will not load the result into memory.
  If there are compilation errors, the will be shown at the bottom of the editor with line numbers on which you can
  click to make the editor scroll to that line number. Note that these line numbers are accurate at the moment the
  compilation took place and will could be inaccurate if you've changed the source code in the meantime.

TODO: More info to come...

## Emulator

The emulator will only stop when the CPU jumps to the same instruction.

You can achieve this with this assembly code:

```
end:
    JMP end
```

export default function({children}) {
    return <article className="prose">{children}</article>
}
