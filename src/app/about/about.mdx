# About

This is a hobby project.

## Technology

This website is using only frond-end code (that only runs in the browser) to operate. There is no server for this,
files are served statically. As a result it does not track you.

However, it is hosted via the <Anchor href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</Anchor> feature of GitHub,
owned by Microsoft. You might want to consult GitHub's privacy policy (where ever that might be) of you have concerns.

Further, this website does not record error or crash reports.

All resources loaded by this website will only come from one origin <span className="font-mono">{config.website}</span>.
If certain optional features require loading resource from third-party origins, you will be prompted for a confirmation before loading them.

To provide the functionality it does, this website is user third-party code (node packages).
<Anchor href={config.githubRepository}>Full source</Anchor> is available on GitHub.
